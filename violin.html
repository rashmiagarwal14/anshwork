The violin is harder than it looks. Your first obsticle will be the bow.  The bow is the stick that comes with the violin. It is very hard to hold! Before playing, tighten the bow, and when you're done playing you have to loosen the bow. You do this by twisting the part that sticks out of the bow onthe out non-pointy side. Don't loosen it too much. If you do, then the hair on the bow wiil fall off. The hair is what makes the sound. After that, you will have to learn how to read music. It is very confusing, so i will not describe how hard it is. You will have to experience it for yourself. A violin is similar to another instrament called the <a href="viola.html">viola</a>.
